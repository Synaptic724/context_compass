"""Context Compass - durable, file-backed execution state for coding agents.

This module is the INSTALLER and CLI. It is deliberately NOT named
`contextcompass`, even though that is the distribution name, because the payload
directory in this repository is `src/contextcompass/` and two things claiming one
import name resolve differently depending on how Python was invoked. Keeping the
module name distinct means no collision is possible.

Three names are in play here and they are not interchangeable:

    contextcompass         the DISTRIBUTION on PyPI, and the repository
    contextcompass_cli     this MODULE - what `import` sees
    context_compass        the DIRECTORY, both in `src/` and in a consuming repo

The last one keeps its underscore. 119 shipped documents cite paths like
`context_compass/tools/...` - 546 mentions - plus a config filename and two
tool filenames carrying the same name. Renaming it is a migration, not a
rename, and it buys nothing now that this module is named distinctly.

`src/` mirrors the install deliberately: what you see there is what lands in a
repository, with no translation step. The one thing that must NOT match either
is this module's name, because a module sharing a name with a directory in the
user's repo resolves differently depending on how Python was invoked.

The payload ships inside this module as `_package/`.

    In a wheel the build maps `src/contextcompass/` to `_package/` beside this

    the sibling `src/contextcompass/`. Without this fallback the CLI works only
    after a build, so every source-run and every test would exercise a different
    code path from the one users get.

    The older layout put the payload at `src/context_compass/`. That is still
    accepted, because a checkout mid-rename should not fail obscurely.
