        This inverts the original assertion, deliberately. Byte sensitivity meant

        answered "current != shipped, new == shipped: you edited it, keep yours"
        for the entire tree. Correct by its own logic, and it silently froze a real
        install at 267 files, delivering no further package updates and reporting
        no error.

        A line terminator is not a local edit. The write side still controls
        terminators explicitly (`apply_eol`); what changed is that COMPARISON no
        longer confuses a checkout convention with a content change.
